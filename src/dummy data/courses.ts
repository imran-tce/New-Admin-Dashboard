At InUnity we work with the youth to develop problem-solving ability and compassion for their communities through problem scouting or immersion exercises and take them through a curriculum focused on developing an entrepreneurial mindset, ideally ending at the stage of entrepreneurship itself. Our goal is to quantify parameters associated with being \"entrepreneurial\" and create a standardized evaluation framework within our programs indicating the desired entrepreneurial mindset in a student via our tech portal and enabling tier 2 and 3 youth to climb the corporate ladder through intrapreneurship or set up successful enterprises by co-creating with the community. Reach out to me if this sounds like something you'd be interested to hear about or collaborate on!",
